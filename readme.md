# mySociety data repo template

This is a self-formatting template for a [mySociety data repo](https://github.com/mysociety/template_data_repo). Based on [Simon Willison's approach](https://simonwillison.net/2021/Aug/28/dynamic-github-repository-templates/).

Click the 'Use this template' button, and give a useful name (snakecase) and description, which will populate the readme.md of the new repo. 

You can also use this link: https://github.com/mysociety/python-data-auto-template/generate

If you have done this, and you are looking at this message in the new repo, wait twenty seconds and refresh. If this message is still here, investigate the status of the Github Action in the 'Actions' tab of the new repo.

## Templating locally

You can also use [Cookie Cutter](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter).

To create a new blank notebook template:

```
cookiecutter gh:mysociety/python-data-auto-template
```

You will be prompted on setup settings.
